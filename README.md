# Expense Reimbursement System
<p> The Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) will manage the process of reimbursing employees for expenses incurred while on company time. All employees in the company can login and submit requests for reimbursement and view their past tickets and pending requests. Finance managers can log in and view all reimbursement requests and past history for all employees in the company. Finance managers are authorized to approve and deny requests for expense reimbursement. </p>

 At the moment, the program runs locally. You will want to have dBeaver and IntelliJ installed, though you can build and launch the code from a CLI.
 <ul>
  <li>Backend:
  <ul> 
    <li> Clone this repository with the command : git clone https://github.com/Ayesha231294/project1.git</li>
    <li> gradle build</li>
    <li> cd build/libs</li>
    <li> java -jar Project1-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar</li>
    <li> Have a Postgres server running at localhost:5432</li>
  </ul>
  <li> Frontend:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Run a server using live-server --port = 8081 </li>
